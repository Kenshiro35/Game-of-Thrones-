# Game-of-Thrones-
Final Project INST377
This project is an HTML code project consisting of the prominent Game of Thrones characters throughout the eight seasons of the show. 
There are many characters that one needs to keep up with in order to have a good viewing experience.
It is also key to understand where each character is from and who they stand with in the show.
I would like to place a character card for each character with an image, their name, their house sigil, the region they are from, who they follow, and some background information on the character.
